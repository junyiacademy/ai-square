# Test True Docs-Only Change

This file tests the FIXED smart skip mechanism.
After the fix, docs-only changes should:

❌ Skip Code Quality & Tests (0s)
❌ Skip Deploy to Cloud Run
❌ Skip Deploy KSA to CDN
✅ Only run Schema Validation (if needed)
✅ Only run Detect Changed Files (5s)

Testing maximum efficiency for documentation updates!
