## Key Integration Points

### API Routes to Update
1. **PBL**:
   - [x] `/api/pbl/scenarios/[id]/start`
   - [x] `/api/pbl/task-logs`
   - [ ] `/api/pbl/programs/[programId]/completion`
   - [ ] `/api/pbl/generate-feedback`

2. **Assessment**:
   - [ ] `/api/assessment/start`
   - [ ] `/api/assessment/submit`
   - [ ] `/api/assessment/complete`

3. **Discovery**:
   - [ ] `/api/discovery/workspace/create`
   - [ ] `/api/discovery/workspace/[id]/update`
   - [ ] `/api/discovery/evaluation`

4. **Chat**:
   - [ ] `/api/chat/session/start`
   - [ ] `/api/chat/message`
   - [ ] `/api/chat/session/end`

### Components to Update
1. **PBL Components**:
   - [ ] `PBLScenarioDetail`
   - [ ] `PBLProgramList`
   - [ ] `PBLTaskLearning`
   - [ ] `PBLCompletion`

2. **Assessment Components**:
   - [ ] `AssessmentStart`
   - [ ] `AssessmentQuestion`
   - [ ] `AssessmentResults`

3. **Discovery Components**:
   - [ ] `DiscoveryWorkspace`
   - [ ] `DiscoveryExploration`
   - [ ] `DiscoveryResults`

4. **Shared Components**:
   - [ ] `UserDashboard`
   - [ ] `LearningProgress`
   - [ ] `ActivityHistory`

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [x] Storage providers
- [x] Repository base classes
- [x] Track service methods
- [x] React hooks
- [ ] Migration adapters

### Integration Tests
- [x] PBL-Track integration
- [ ] Assessment-Track integration
- [ ] Discovery-Track integration
- [ ] Cross-feature queries

### E2E Tests
- [ ] Complete PBL journey with Track
- [ ] Assessment flow with Track
- [ ] Discovery session with Track
- [ ] Dashboard functionality

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Performance**:
   - Track creation time
   - Query response time
   - Storage usage

2. **Usage**:
   - Active Tracks per user
   - Completion rates
   - Average session duration

3. **Errors**:
   - Failed Track operations
   - Migration errors
   - Sync failures

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise:
1. **Minor Issues**: 
   - Disable Track creation in API routes
   - Continue using existing storage
   - Fix issues and redeploy

2. **Major Issues**:
   - Revert API route changes
   - Keep Track system isolated
   - Investigate and fix offline

3. **Data Corruption**:
   - Restore from backups
   - Run data validation scripts
   - Implement additional safeguards

## Success Criteria

### Phase 2 (PBL) Success:
- [ ] All PBL activities create Tracks
- [ ] Track data matches PBL data
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Zero data loss

### Overall Success:
- [ ] All features integrated with Track
- [ ] Unified dashboard functional
- [ ] Analytics providing insights
- [ ] Improved user experience
- [ ] Maintainable codebase

## Notes & Considerations

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Track system supplements existing storage, doesn't replace it
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Implement feature by feature
3. **User Impact**: Minimal disruption to existing users
4. **Data Integrity**: Maintain consistency between Track and feature-specific storage
5. **Performance**: Monitor closely during rollout
