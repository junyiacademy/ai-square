# Schema V3 Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated to Schema V3 with mode propagation to avoid excessive JOINs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (schema-v3.sql)
- Added `mode` column to `programs`, `tasks`, and `evaluations` tables
- Created automatic triggers for mode propagation:
  - `programs.mode` is automatically set from `scenarios.mode`
  - `tasks.mode` is automatically set from `programs.mode`
  - `evaluations.mode` is automatically set from `tasks.mode` or `programs.mode`
- Added indexes on mode columns for efficient querying
- Created helper functions for mode-based queries

### 2. TypeScript Types (database.ts)
- Added `mode: LearningMode` to `DBProgram`
- Added `mode: LearningMode` to `DBTask`
- Added `mode: LearningMode` to `DBEvaluation`

### 3. Interface Updates (unified-learning.ts)
- Added `mode: LearningMode` to `IProgram`
- Added `mode: LearningMode` to `ITask`
- Added `mode: LearningMode` to `IEvaluation`

### 4. Repository Updates
- Updated `PostgreSQLProgramRepository` to include mode in toProgram()
- Updated `PostgreSQLTaskRepository` to include mode in toTask()
- Updated `PostgreSQLEvaluationRepository` to include mode in toEvaluation()
- No changes needed to INSERT statements - mode is automatically propagated by triggers

## Benefits

### 1. Performance Improvements
```sql
-- Before (required JOINs)
SELECT * FROM evaluations e
JOIN tasks t ON e.task_id = t.id
JOIN programs p ON t.program_id = p.id
JOIN scenarios s ON p.scenario_id = s.id
WHERE s.mode = 'pbl';

-- After (direct query)
SELECT * FROM evaluations WHERE mode = 'pbl';
```

### 2. Simpler Queries
- Can filter programs, tasks, and evaluations by mode directly
- No need to join back to scenarios table
- Improved query performance with mode indexes

### 3. Data Integrity
- Mode is automatically propagated via triggers
- Ensures consistency across related records
- Cannot have mismatched modes between scenario and its programs/tasks/evaluations

## Migration Status
✅ Schema created and tested
✅ TypeScript types updated
✅ Interfaces updated
✅ Repository implementations updated
✅ Mode propagation tested and working

## Next Steps
1. Update API routes to use new schema
2. Implement sourceRef unification for all modes
3. Update tests to support new sourceRef structure
