    The_Nature_of_AI:
      codes:
        K1.1:
          summary: "AI systems use algorithms that combine step-by-step procedures with statistical inferences (e.g., weights and biases) to process data, detect patterns, and generate probable outputs."
          summary_zh: "AI系統使用演算法結合步驟程序與統計推論（如權重和偏差）來處理資料、偵測模式並產生可能的輸出。"
        K1.2:
          summary: "Machines 'learn' by inferring how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, and recommendations that influence physical or virtual environments, in response to information from the input they receive. They do so with varying levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment."
          summary_zh: "機器透過推論如何產生預測、內容與建議等輸出來「學習」，這些輸出會影響實體或虛擬環境，並根據接收到的輸入資訊，在部署後以不同程度的自主性與適應性運作。"
        K1.3:
          summary: "Generative AI uses probabilities to generate human-like outputs across various modalities (e.g., text, audio, visuals) but lacks authentic understanding and intent."
          summary_zh: "生成式AI利用機率產生各種模態的類人輸出（如文字、音訊、視覺），但缺乏真正的理解與意圖。"
        K1.4:
          summary: "AI systems operate differently depending on their purpose, whether to create, predict, recommend, or respond."
          summary_zh: "AI系統依其目的不同而有不同運作方式，可能用於創作、預測、推薦或回應。"
      explanation: |
        AI systems—including, but not limited to, classifiers, recommenders, predictive models, generative AI, and autonomous agents – operate by processing vast datasets to identify statistical patterns. As a broad class of technology, AI simulates intelligent behavior. Whether generating content, sorting information, making predictions, or executing sequences of actions, these systems aim to produce outputs that are statistically most likely to meet a given objective. While these systems can produce highly sophisticated and human-like outputs, they do so without comprehension, awareness, or intent. Understanding this distinction dispels the misconception that AI is all-knowing or consistently correct, and helps learners assess its reliability, limitations, and potential impact.
      explanation_zh: |
        AI系統（包括但不限於分類器、推薦系統、預測模型、生成式AI及自主代理）透過處理大量資料集來識別統計模式。AI作為一種廣義技術類別，模擬智慧行為。無論是產生內容、整理資訊、做出預測或執行一連串動作，這些系統的目標都是產生統計上最有可能達成既定目標的輸出。雖然這些系統能產生高度複雜且類似人類的結果，但它們並不具備理解、意識或意圖。理解這一點有助於破除「AI無所不知、永遠正確」的迷思，並協助學習者評估其可靠性、限制與潛在影響。

          summary_zh: "AI系統本質上存在偏見，也可能反映嵌入在訓練資料或演算法設計中的社會偏見。人類可在設計、開發或測試過程中延續或減緩AI系統中的有害偏見。"
      explanation: |
        AI is not neutral; it is shaped by the decisions of those who build it. Humans select training data, which may have been collected unethically or feature inaccurate and incomplete representations of individuals and perspectives. They also impart judgment during the classification of that training data, which informs the algorithms that produce AI systems' outputs. While statistical and societal biases may exist undetected in training data or be reinforced in other aspects of the training process, AI's prevalence in decision-making and everyday life can replicate those biases in ways that harmfully affect different groups of people. This makes ethics, algorithmic fairness, representation, explainability, and accountability essential to AI literacy.
      explanation_zh: |
        AI並非中立，而是由開發者的決策所形塑。人類選擇訓練資料，這些資料可能以不道德方式蒐集，或對個人與觀點的呈現不準確且不完整。人類在分類訓練資料時也會加入判斷，這些都會影響產生AI輸出的演算法。統計與社會偏見可能潛藏於訓練資料中未被發現，或在訓練過程的其他面向被強化。AI在決策與日常生活中的普及，可能讓這些偏見以有害方式影響不同群體。因此，倫理、演算法公平性、代表性、可解釋性與問責制是AI素養不可或缺的要素。

          summary_zh: "雖然AI可協助分析與預測，但人類必須對反映人類判斷與倫理考量的決策負責。"
      explanation: |
        The impact of AI across industries emphasizes the importance of adaptability and lifelong learning. While AI systems can increase efficiency for many types of tasks, these tools might not always be the best choice; humans must hone their knowledge of AI's capabilities and their domain expertise to manage AI systems effectively. Success in an AI-integrated workforce entails developing fluency in a range of technologies, staying current with new tools and techniques, and leveraging human judgment in decision-making starting from early ages, in and outside of formal education. This combination ensures that AI complements human skills and augments human capacities, rather than replaces them.
      explanation_zh: |
        AI對各產業的影響凸顯了適應力與終身學習的重要性。雖然AI系統能提升許多類型任務的效率，但這些工具並非總是最佳選擇；人類必須精進對AI能力的理解與專業領域知識，才能有效管理AI系統。在AI整合的工作環境中成功，需要培養對多種技術的熟練度、跟上新工具與技術的發展，並從小開始在正式與非正式教育中善用人類判斷進行決策。這種結合確保AI補足人類技能、增強人類能力，而非取代人類。

    AIs_Capabilities_and_Limitations:

          summary_zh: "生成式AI（特別是大型語言模型）產生類人內容的能力，可能導致事實與虛構難以分辨，增加產生錯誤資訊、深度偽造或操弄材料的可能性。"
      explanation: |
        AI lacks a true grasp of real-world context, human values and behaviors, and nuance—even when systems modify their own outputs to respond to a user's complex emotional states. While AI systems can analyze enormous amounts of data, they are prone to bias, confabulation, and misuse and rely on vast but finite natural resources. A human must make judgments about specific contexts that AI systems cannot, including whether the benefits of an AI tool is worth the environmental or societal cost. AI literacy requires critical thinking about when, where, and how AI should be applied to ensure it serves human needs equitably.
      explanation_zh: |
        AI缺乏對現實世界情境、人類價值與行為以及細微差異的真正理解——即使系統能修改輸出來回應使用者複雜的情緒狀態。雖然AI系統能分析大量資料，但容易產生偏見、虛構與誤用，且仰賴龐大但有限的自然資源。人類必須針對AI系統無法判斷的特定情境做出決策，包括評估AI工具的效益是否值得其環境或社會成本。AI素養需要批判性思考何時、何地、如何應用AI，確保其公平服務人類需求。

          summary_zh: "倫理AI設計涵蓋公平性、透明度、可解釋性、問責制、隱私尊重與法規遵循。"
      explanation: |
        AI systems do not exist in isolation; their use reflects, reinforces, and reshapes societal values and decisions. Without careful oversight, AI-driven decision-making can amplify bias and cause widespread harm. AI systems introduce implications for how learners should think about truth, authorship, and ownership in digital spaces. Individual and system-level guidance and regulations can help address areas where AI intersects with fundamental rights, such as surveillance and data privacy. Familiarity with ethical AI design principles helps learners to critically assess how AI systems are built and deployed. Without the understanding, learners risk accepting AI outputs at face value rather than asking whom they benefit or harm. To ensure AI serves society responsibly, we must continuously question and evaluate its effects and guide its use to mitigate its risks.
      explanation_zh: |
        AI系統並非孤立存在；其使用會反映、強化並重塑社會價值與決策。若缺乏審慎監督，AI驅動的決策可能放大偏見並造成廣泛傷害。AI系統引入了學習者應如何思考數位空間中真實性、作者身分與所有權的議題。個人與系統層級的指導與規範有助於處理AI與基本權利（如監控與資料隱私）交集的領域。熟悉倫理AI設計原則有助於學習者批判性評估AI系統的建構與部署。若缺乏這種理解，學習者可能會表面接受AI輸出，而不問它們對誰有益或有害。為確保AI負責任地服務社會，我們必須持續質疑與評估其影響，並引導其使用以減輕風險。
