# AI Literacy Domains Template
# This template defines the structure for language-specific domain files
# Each language file should follow this structure and translate all [TRANSLATE] values

domains:
  # Domain IDs (Engaging_with_AI, Creating_with_AI, Managing_AI, Designing_AI) 
  # should remain in English - DO NOT TRANSLATE
  [DOMAIN_ID]:  # e.g., Engaging_with_AI
    emoji: [KEEP_SAME]  # Keep emoji same across all languages
    overview: "[TRANSLATE: Domain overview description in target language]"
    competencies:
      # Competency IDs (E1, E2, C1, C2, etc.) should remain in English - DO NOT TRANSLATE
      [COMPETENCY_ID]:  # e.g., E1, E2, C1, C2, M1, M2, D1, D2
        description: "[TRANSLATE: Competency description in target language]"
        knowledge:  # Keep same across all languages
          - [K_CODE]  # e.g., K1.1, K1.2
          - [K_CODE]
        skills:  # Keep same across all languages
          - [S_CODE]  # e.g., S1.1, S2.1
          - [S_CODE]
        attitudes:  # Keep same across all languages
          - [A_CODE]  # e.g., A1.1, A2.1
          - [A_CODE]
        content: "[TRANSLATE: Detailed content description explaining what learners do in target language]"
        scenarios:
          - "[TRANSLATE: Scenario example 1 in target language]"
          - "[TRANSLATE: Scenario example 2 in target language]"

# Translation Guidelines:
# 1. Domain IDs must remain in English (Engaging_with_AI, Creating_with_AI, etc.)
# 2. Competency IDs must remain in English (E1, E2, C1, C2, M1, M2, D1, D2, etc.)
# 3. KSA codes must remain unchanged (K1.1, S2.1, A3.1, etc.)
# 4. Emojis should remain the same across all languages
# 5. All descriptive text marked with [TRANSLATE] must be translated
# 6. Scenarios should be culturally adapted while maintaining the educational intent

# Structure Overview:
# - 4 domains total: Engaging_with_AI, Creating_with_AI, Managing_AI, Designing_AI
# - Each domain has multiple competencies (5-6 per domain)
# - Each competency maps to specific Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes codes
# - Each competency includes practical scenario examples
