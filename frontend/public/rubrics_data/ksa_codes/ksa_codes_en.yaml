    AI_Reflects_Human_Choices_and_Perspectives:
      codes:
        K2.1:
          summary: Building and maintaining AI systems relies on humans to design algorithms, collect and label data, and moderate harmful content. These systems reflect human choices, assumptions, and labor practices, shaped by unequal global conditions.
        K2.2:
          summary: AI is trained on vast datasets sourced from publicly available information, user-generated content, curated databases, and real-world data collected through sensors, interactions, and digital systems.
        K2.3:
          summary: AI systems gather new data from interactions with users; decisions, processes, and outputs may be directly influenced by inputs in real time.
        K2.4:
          summary: AI systems are trained to identify patterns among data elements that humans have selected, categorized, and prioritized.
        K2.5:
          summary: Bias inherently exists in AI systems, which can also reflect societal biases embedded in its training data or algorithm design. Humans can perpetuate or mitigate harmful biases in AI systems during the design, development, or testing process.
      explanation: |
        AI is not neutral; it is shaped by the decisions of those who build it. Humans select training data, which may have been collected unethically or feature inaccurate and incomplete representations of individuals and perspectives. They also impart judgment during the classification of that training data, which informs the algorithms that produce AI systems' outputs. While statistical and societal biases may exist undetected in training data or be reinforced in other aspects of the training process, AI's prevalence in decision-making and everyday life can replicate those biases in ways that harmfully affect different groups of people. This makes ethics, algorithmic fairness, representation, explainability, and accountability essential to AI literacy.
    AI_Reshapes_Work_and_Human_Roles:
      codes:
        K3.1:
          summary: AI systems automate structured tasks, augment decision-making, and transform industries, requiring humans to adapt, reskill, and upskill.
        K3.2:
          summary: AI integration requires individuals to determine which tasks are best suited for machines and which require human intervention or expertise.
        K3.3:
          summary: While AI can support analysis and prediction, humans must be responsible for decisions that reflect human judgment and ethical considerations.
      explanation: |
        The impact of AI across industries emphasizes the importance of adaptability and lifelong learning. While AI systems can increase efficiency for many types of tasks, these tools might not always be the best choice; humans must hone their knowledge of AI's capabilities and their domain expertise to manage AI systems effectively. Success in an AI-integrated workforce entails developing fluency in a range of technologies, staying current with new tools and techniques, and leveraging human judgment in decision-making starting from early ages, in and outside of formal education. This combination ensures that AI complements human skills and augments human capacities, rather than replaces them.
    AIs_Capabilities_and_Limitations:
      codes:
        K4.1:
          summary: AI excels at pattern recognition and automation but lacks emotions, ethical reasoning, context, and originality.
        K4.2:
          summary: AI requires vast amounts of computing power and data, which consumes energy, thus demanding limited natural resources and increasing carbon emissions. AI's long-term sustainability impact, both positive and negative, largely depends on how it is implemented and utilized.
        K4.3:
          summary: The capability of generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), to generate humanlike content can make it difficult to distinguish fact from fabrication, increasing the potential to generate misinformation, deepfakes, or manipulative materials.
      explanation: |
        AI lacks a true grasp of real-world context, human values and behaviors, and nuanceâ€”even when systems modify their own outputs to respond to a user's complex emotional states. While AI systems can analyze enormous amounts of data, they are prone to bias, confabulation, and misuse and rely on vast but finite natural resources. A human must make judgments about specific contexts that AI systems cannot, including whether the benefits of an AI tool is worth the environmental or societal cost. AI literacy requires critical thinking about when, where, and how AI should be applied to ensure it serves human needs equitably.
    AIs_Role_in_Society:

          summary: AI plays an increasingly prevalent role in decision-making that impacts humans, from hiring practices to healthcare to criminal justice.
        K5.2:
          summary: AI systems must be understood, audited, and regulated to ensure that their use leads to more benefits than harm for individuals and society.
        K5.3:
          summary: Generative AI and Large Language Models create content based on existing materials in training data, which includes copyright-protected work, thereby raising questions about authenticity, authorship, and ownership.
        K5.4:
          summary: Ethical AI design encompasses fairness, transparency, explainability, accountability, respect for privacy, and legal compliance.
      explanation: |
        AI systems do not exist in isolation; their use reflects, reinforces, and reshapes societal values and decisions. Without careful oversight, AI-driven decision-making can amplify bias and cause widespread harm. AI systems introduce implications for how learners should think about truth, authorship, and ownership in digital spaces. Individual and system-level guidance and regulations can help address areas where AI intersects with fundamental rights, such as surveillance and data privacy. Familiarity with ethical AI design principles helps learners to critically assess how AI systems are built and deployed. Without the understanding, learners risk accepting AI outputs at face value rather than asking whom they benefit or harm. To ensure AI serves society responsibly, we must continuously question and evaluate its effects and guide its use to mitigate its risks.
