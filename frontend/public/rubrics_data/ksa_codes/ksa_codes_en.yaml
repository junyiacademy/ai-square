    The_Nature_of_AI:
      codes:
        K1.1:
          summary: AI systems process data through algorithms to recognize patterns, make predictions, and generate outputs without explicit programming for each specific task.
        K1.2:
          summary: AI systems vary in complexity and capability, from simple rule-based systems to advanced machine learning models that can adapt and improve through experience.
        K1.3:
          summary: AI outputs are probabilistic rather than deterministic, meaning they provide likely answers based on patterns in data rather than guaranteed correct solutions.
        K1.4:
          summary: AI systems are embedded in many everyday technologies and services, often operating invisibly to enhance functionality and user experience.
      explanation: |
        Understanding AI's fundamental nature is essential for informed interaction. AI systems are computational tools that process information differently from humans, using statistical patterns rather than true comprehension. They range from simple automated rules to complex neural networks, but all share the characteristic of making probabilistic judgments based on training data. Recognizing AI's pervasive presence in daily life—from search engines to recommendation systems—helps learners identify when they're interacting with AI and understand its influence on their experiences.
    AI_Reflects_Human_Choices_and_Perspectives:
      codes:
        K2.1:
          summary: Building and maintaining AI systems relies on humans to design algorithms, collect and label data, and moderate harmful content. These systems reflect human choices, assumptions, and labor practices, shaped by unequal global conditions.
        K2.2:
          summary: AI is trained on vast datasets sourced from publicly available information, user-generated content, curated databases, and real-world data collected through sensors, interactions, and digital systems.
        K2.3:
          summary: AI systems gather new data from interactions with users; decisions, processes, and outputs may be directly influenced by inputs in real time.
        K2.4:
          summary: AI systems are trained to identify patterns among data elements that humans have selected, categorized, and prioritized.
        K2.5:
          summary: Bias inherently exists in AI systems, which can also reflect societal biases embedded in its training data or algorithm design. Humans can perpetuate or mitigate harmful biases in AI systems during the design, development, or testing process.
      explanation: |
        AI is not neutral; it is shaped by the decisions of those who build it. Humans select training data, which may have been collected unethically or feature inaccurate and incomplete representations of individuals and perspectives. They also impart judgment during the classification of that training data, which informs the algorithms that produce AI systems' outputs. While statistical and societal biases may exist undetected in training data or be reinforced in other aspects of the training process, AI's prevalence in decision-making and everyday life can replicate those biases in ways that harmfully affect different groups of people. This makes ethics, algorithmic fairness, representation, explainability, and accountability essential to AI literacy.
    AI_Reshapes_Work_and_Human_Roles:
      codes:
        K3.1:
          summary: AI systems automate structured tasks, augment decision-making, and transform industries, requiring humans to adapt, reskill, and upskill.

        K5.2:
          summary: AI systems must be understood, audited, and regulated to ensure that their use leads to more benefits than harm for individuals and society.
        K5.3:
          summary: Generative AI and Large Language Models create content based on existing materials in training data, which includes copyright-protected work, thereby raising questions about authenticity, authorship, and ownership.
        K5.4:
          summary: Ethical AI design encompasses fairness, transparency, explainability, accountability, respect for privacy, and legal compliance.
      explanation: |
        AI systems do not exist in isolation; their use reflects, reinforces, and reshapes societal values and decisions. Without careful oversight, AI-driven decision-making can amplify bias and cause widespread harm. AI systems introduce implications for how learners should think about truth, authorship, and ownership in digital spaces. Individual and system-level guidance and regulations can help address areas where AI intersects with fundamental rights, such as surveillance and data privacy. Familiarity with ethical AI design principles helps learners to critically assess how AI systems are built and deployed. Without the understanding, learners risk accepting AI outputs at face value rather than asking whom they benefit or harm. To ensure AI serves society responsibly, we must continuously question and evaluate its effects and guide its use to mitigate its risks.
