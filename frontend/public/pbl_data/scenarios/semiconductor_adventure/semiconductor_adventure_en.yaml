  title: My Semiconductor Adventure
  description: 'Embark on an exciting adventure to discover how a simple grain of
    sand transforms into the powerful chips that power our modern world! (Suggested
    age: 13+, suitable for middle school students and above)'
  prerequisites:
  - Basic understanding of elements and compounds
  - Familiarity with electricity and electrical devices
  - 'Recommended: Watch this introductory video - https://youtu.be/cxf6eexA4f0'
  learning_objectives:
  - Experience the ubiquity of chips in daily life and connect their raw material
    "silicon" with natural "sand"
  - Understand that the core of chips consists of "transistors" acting as "switches",
    with the key being semiconductors' controllable electrical conductivity
  - Learn the basic concept of "Moore's Law" and explain why technology products continue
    to get faster and smaller
