      - **Conductors** (like metals) easily conduct electricity
      - **Insulators** (like rubber) don't conduct electricity
      - **Semiconductors** have conductivity between the two, and can be controlled

      ### Science Review: Electric Current
      Electric current is like many tiny "electrons" moving in the same direction through a wire.
