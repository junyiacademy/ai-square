# Translation Guidelines:
# 1. All fields marked with [TRANSLATE: ...] must be translated to the target language
# 2. Fields marked "Keep same" should remain identical across all language versions
# 3. IDs, codes, URLs, and technical values should not be translated
# 4. The ai_module.initial_prompt is critical - ensure it's fully translated so the AI responds in the correct language
# 5. Maintain the same meaning and educational intent while adapting to cultural context
