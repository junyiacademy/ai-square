# PBL Module Flow Testing Report

## Test Date: 2025-07-18

## Testing Plan
1. Scenarios List ‚Üí View available scenarios
2. Scenario Detail ‚Üí View specific scenario details  
3. New Program ‚Üí Start a new learning session
4. Task Performance ‚Üí Complete tasks/interactions
5. Evaluation ‚Üí View results and feedback
6. Check old programs and their accessibility

## Test Results

### 1. Scenarios List API ‚úÖ
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/pbl/scenarios?lang=en`
- **Status**: Working correctly
- **Response**: 
  - Returns 11 scenarios (9 available, 2 unavailable)
  - Each scenario has proper UUID
  - Includes yamlId for backward compatibility
  - Contains all required fields (title, description, difficulty, etc.)

### 2. Scenario Detail API ‚úÖ
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/pbl/scenarios/{id}?lang=en`
- **Status**: Working correctly
- **Test scenario**: high-school-climate-change (UUID: 3087f318-6a13-4f1c-926c-75625315ea85)
- **Response**:
  - Returns complete scenario details
  - Includes 4 tasks with proper structure
  - KSA mapping is populated correctly
  - Task metadata includes AI module configuration

### 3. Start New Program API ‚úÖ
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/pbl/scenarios/{id}/start`
- **Status**: Working correctly
- **Response**:
  - Creates program with UUID
  - Creates tasks with UUIDs
  - Returns proper program structure
  - Task status properly initialized (first task active, others pending)

### 4. Task Interaction (Chat) API ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/pbl/chat`
- **Status**: Partially working
- **Issues**:
  - Requires complex context object
  - Authentication check appears to be working
  - Scenario lookup fails with "Scenario not found" error
  - May be related to UUID vs yamlId lookup issue

### 5. Evaluation API ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/pbl/evaluate`
- **Status**: Not fully tested
- **Issues**:
  - Requires conversations and task context
  - More complex than expected payload structure

### 6. User Programs Retrieval ‚ùå
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/pbl/user-programs?scenarioId={id}`
- **Status**: Issue detected
- **Problem**: Returns empty array even after creating a program
- **Possible causes**:
  - GCS storage might not be persisting data correctly
  - User email mismatch in queries
  - Timing issue with eventual consistency

### 7. Completion API ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/pbl/completion`
- **Status**: Partially tested
- **Issues**:
  - Requires both programId and scenarioId
  - Returns "Missing required parameters" even with both params
  - May have additional undocumented requirements

### 8. Program History API üîÑ
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/pbl/history`
- **Status**: Not fully tested due to timeout

## Key Findings

### Working Well:
1. **Scenario Discovery**: Users can browse and view scenarios successfully
2. **Program Creation**: New learning sessions start correctly with proper UUID assignment
3. **Data Structure**: The unified learning architecture is working for basic operations
4. **Authentication**: Cookie-based auth is functioning

### Issues Identified:
1. **Data Persistence**: Programs created don't appear in user programs list
2. **API Complexity**: Some endpoints require complex, undocumented payload structures
3. **UUID vs YAML ID**: Inconsistent handling between different endpoints
4. **Chat Integration**: The AI chat feature has integration issues with scenario lookup

### Recommendations:
1. **Fix Data Persistence**: Investigate why created programs aren't retrievable
2. **Simplify APIs**: Reduce required fields where possible
3. **Improve Documentation**: Add OpenAPI/Swagger docs for complex endpoints
4. **Consistent ID Handling**: Standardize on UUID usage across all endpoints
5. **Add Integration Tests**: Automated tests for the complete user flow
6. **Error Messages**: Make error responses more descriptive

## Conclusion

The PBL module has the basic infrastructure in place and can create learning sessions, but there are critical issues with data retrieval and AI integration that prevent users from completing the full learning flow. The most urgent issue is fixing the data persistence problem that prevents users from accessing their created programs.
