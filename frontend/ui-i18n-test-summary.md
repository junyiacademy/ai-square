## 📈 Mode-by-Mode Analysis

| Stage | Page Status | i18n Status | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------------|-------|
| List | ✅ Exists | ❌ No i18n | Redirect to /pbl/scenarios |
| Detail | ✅ Exists | ✅ Has i18n | Scenario details page |
| Learn | ✅ Exists | ✅ Has i18n | Task learning with AI chat |
| Complete | ✅ Exists | ✅ Has i18n | Completion with feedback |
| History | ❌ Missing | - | Not implemented |

### Assessment Mode
| Stage | Page Status | i18n Status | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------------|-------|
| List | ✅ Exists | ✅ Has i18n | Assessment list page |
| Detail | ✅ Exists | ✅ Has i18n | Scenario details |
| Learn | ✅ Exists | ✅ Has i18n | Question answering |
| Complete | ✅ Exists | ✅ Has i18n | Results display |
| History | ❌ Missing | - | Not implemented |

### Discovery Mode
| Stage | Page Status | i18n Status | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------------|-------|
| List | ✅ Exists | ❌ No i18n | Redirect to /discovery/overview |
| Detail | ✅ Exists | ✅ Has i18n | Scenario details |
| Learn | ✅ Exists | ✅ Has i18n | Interactive exploration |
| Complete | ❌ Missing | - | Not implemented |
| History | ❌ Missing | - | Not implemented |

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Complete i18n Infrastructure**: All 14 languages have translation files
2. **Strong i18n Coverage**: 82% of existing pages have internationalization
3. **Consistent Implementation**: Assessment mode is fully implemented (4/5 stages)
4. **API Support**: All existing API routes support language parameters

### Gaps
1. **Missing History Pages**: None of the 3 modes have history/review functionality
2. **Discovery Incomplete**: Missing completion page for Discovery mode
3. **Redirect Pages**: List pages are just redirects, don't need i18n

## 🎯 Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Implement Discovery Completion Page** (`/discovery/scenarios/[id]/programs/[programId]/complete`)
   - Show exploration summary
   - Display discovered concepts
   - Provide recommendations

### Medium Priority
2. **Add History Pages** for all modes:
   - `/pbl/history` - Review past PBL scenarios
   - `/assessment/history` - View assessment results over time
   - `/discovery/history` - Track exploration journey

### Low Priority
3. **Consider Unified History**: Instead of 3 separate history pages, consider a unified learning history that shows all activities across modes

## 📝 Technical Notes

### i18n Implementation Pattern
Pages with i18n properly use:
- `useTranslation` hook from react-i18next
- Translation keys following module naming convention (e.g., `pbl:learn.title`)
- Support for dynamic language switching

### Missing API Route
- `/api/discovery/generate-report/route.ts` is referenced but doesn't exist
- This might be planned functionality for Discovery mode

## ✅ No Action Needed
- PBL and Discovery list pages are just redirects - no i18n needed
- All translation files are present and properly configured
- Existing pages have good i18n coverage (82%)

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Create Discovery completion page
2. Design and implement history/review functionality
3. Test actual language switching in UI
4. Verify all translation keys have values in all 14 languages
