description: 'refactor: simplify dev logs structure by removing subdirectory categorization


  - Flattened all dev logs to be directly under date folders

  - Moved 35 files from subdirectories (features/, bugfixes/, etc.) to date folder
  root

  - Updated ADR-017 to reflect new simplified structure

  - Updated handbook guides (development-logs-guide.md, commit-guide.md)

  - Updated dev-logs README.md to match new structure

  - Removed redundant subdirectory categorization since filenames already contain
  type info

  - Cleaned up temporary migration script


  The new structure is simpler and relies on clear filenames for categorization.'
