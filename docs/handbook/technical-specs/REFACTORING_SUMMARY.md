# CMS Documentation Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring of `content-management.md` and `cms-setup.md` to remove duplications and clarify scope.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Cross-References
Both documents now have clear cross-references at the top:
- Links to related documents
- Clear description of each document's purpose

### 2. Removed Duplications

#### From content-management.md:
- ❌ Removed Git-Based Content Workflow section (moved to cms-setup.md)
- ❌ Removed detailed implementation roadmap (reference to cms-setup.md)
- ✅ Kept detailed technical specifications and code examples

#### From cms-setup.md:
- ❌ Simplified API design section (detailed specs in content-management.md)
- ✅ Added consolidated implementation roadmap
- ✅ Added Git-Based workflow details

### 3. Clarified Document Scope

#### content-management.md
**Purpose**: Technical specification for content management features
- Visual rubrics builder implementation
- AI content generation details
- Media library system
- Version control system
- Detailed API specifications
- Database schemas

#### cms-setup.md
**Purpose**: Setup, configuration, and deployment guide
- Git-Based architecture overview
- Deployment strategies
- Infrastructure configuration
- Consolidated implementation roadmap
- Technical decision records

## Document Structure

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Feature specs vs. deployment/config
   - No duplicate information

2. **Single Source of Truth**
   - Implementation roadmap in one place
   - Git workflow in appropriate document

3. **Better Navigation**
   - Cross-references guide readers
   - Clear document purposes

4. **Maintainability**
   - Easier to update without conflicts
   - Clear ownership of information

## Next Steps

1. Update other technical specs to follow this pattern
2. Create an index document linking all technical specs
3. Ensure all references are kept up-to-date
