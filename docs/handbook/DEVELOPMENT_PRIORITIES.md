## Current Phase: 1-2 MVP (Now - June 2025)

### ðŸ”´ Critical Path (Must Complete)

#### 1. Fix Authentication Flow
**Blocker**: Users can't save progress without proper auth
- [ ] Fix logout functionality
- [ ] Implement session persistence
- [ ] Add "Remember Me" option
- [ ] Handle token refresh
- **Owner**: Backend team
- **Deadline**: Feb 2025

#### 2. Complete PBL Implementation
**Status**: 70% complete
- [ ] Fix response validation
- [ ] Add progress saving
- [ ] Implement retry mechanism
- [ ] Polish UI/UX
- **Owner**: Full-stack team
- **Deadline**: Feb 2025

#### 3. Content Validation System
**Why**: Ensure Git-based content quality
- [ ] YAML schema validation
- [ ] Automated content tests
- [ ] PR validation workflow
- [ ] Error reporting
- **Owner**: Backend team
- **Deadline**: Mar 2025

### ðŸŸ¡ Important (Should Complete)

#### 4. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement proper caching strategy
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Improve Core Web Vitals
- **Target**: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms

#### 5. Error Handling & Monitoring
- [ ] Comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Basic error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Health check endpoints

#### 6. Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] Content contributor guide
- [ ] Architecture decisions record (ADR)

### ðŸŸ¢ Nice to Have (If Time Permits)

#### 7. Developer Experience
- [ ] Local development setup script
- [ ] Hot reload improvements
- [ ] Better TypeScript types
- [ ] Component storybook

#### 8. UI Polish
- [ ] Animation improvements
- [ ] Dark mode refinement
- [ ] Mobile experience optimization
- [ ] Accessibility audit

## Phase 2 Preparation (April - June 2025)

### Planning Tasks
1. **CMS Architecture Design**
   - Define API contracts
   - Plan Git integration strategy
   - Design caching layer

2. **Multi-language Strategy**
   - Audit current translation coverage
   - Plan editor UI/UX
   - Estimate translation costs

3. **Infrastructure Planning**
   - Estimate Redis requirements
   - Plan migration strategy
   - Cost projections

## Technical Debt Registry

### High Priority Debt
1. **Authentication State Management**
   - Current: Local state scattered
   - Target: Centralized auth context
   - Impact: High - affects all features

2. **Type Safety**
   - Current: Many `any` types
   - Target: Full type coverage
   - Impact: Medium - developer velocity

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Current: ~30%
   - Target: 70%+
   - Impact: High - deployment confidence

### Medium Priority Debt
1. **Component Structure**
   - Some components too large
   - Need better separation of concerns

2. **API Client**
   - Inconsistent error handling
   - No request retry logic

3. **Build Configuration**
   - Optimization opportunities
   - Environment variable management

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1-2 Goals
- [ ] 100+ daily active users
- [ ] < 3s page load time
- [ ] 95%+ uptime
- [ ] 50+ completed PBL sessions

### Quality Gates
Before moving to Phase 2:
- [ ] All critical bugs fixed
- [ ] Core features working reliably
- [ ] Basic monitoring in place
- [ ] Deployment process documented

## Resource Allocation

### Current Team Focus
- **Frontend (2 devs)**: 70% features, 30% polish
- **Backend (1 dev)**: 60% API, 40% infrastructure
- **Full-stack (1 dev)**: 50% integration, 50% testing

### Recommended Adjustments
- Increase testing effort to 20%
- Add dedicated DevOps time (10%)
- Regular tech debt sprints (1 per month)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Git-based scaling**
   - Monitor repo size
   - Plan sharding strategy
   - Implement caching early

2. **Authentication complexity**
   - Keep it simple in Phase 1
   - Plan for future migration
   - Document all decisions

### Business Risks
1. **User adoption**
   - Focus on core experience
   - Gather feedback early
   - Iterate quickly

2. **Content quality**
   - Implement validation
   - Create clear guidelines
   - Build review process
