description: Fix authentication and UI issues in CMS dashboard
dev_log:
  sessions:
  - activities:
    - Debugged CMS dashboard showing 0 counts for all document types
    - Identified authentication token mismatch between localStorage and cookies
    - Added cookie storage during login process using js-cookie library
    - Updated logout to clear both localStorage and cookies
    - Fixed login form UI issue with white text on white background
    - Tested GCS integration after authentication fix
    ai_interactions:
    - Assisted with debugging authentication issue
    - Helped implement cookie storage solution
    - Fixed UI visibility issue in login form
    challenges:
    - CMS dashboard was fetching data but showing 0 counts
    - Authentication working in UI but failing in API routes
    - Login form inputs were invisible due to color mismatch
    date: '2025-06-26'
    decisions:
    - Store auth token in both localStorage and cookies for compatibility
    - Use js-cookie library for reliable cookie management
    - Change input text color to gray-900 for visibility
