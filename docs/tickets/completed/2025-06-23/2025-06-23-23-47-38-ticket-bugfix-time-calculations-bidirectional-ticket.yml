description: 'fix(devlog): fix time calculations and implement bidirectional ticket
  linking


  - Fix dev log time calculation errors (was showing 0.7min instead of 10.6min)

  - Implement bidirectional linking between tickets and dev logs

  - Add automatic ticket creation if no active ticket exists

  - Convert ticket system from JSON to YAML with timestamps

  - Fix all existing dev log filenames to include timestamps

  - Update pre-commit and post-commit scripts for better time handling

  - Add ADR-027 documenting dev log standards enforcement


  Key fixes:

  - Pre-commit now properly calculates time from git history

  - Post-commit preserves pre-commit time calculations unless it has better data

  - Dev log filenames now include HH-MM-SS timestamps

  - Tickets and dev logs reference each other''s paths'
