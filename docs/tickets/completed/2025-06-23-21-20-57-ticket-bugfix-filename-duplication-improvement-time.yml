description: 'fix(dev-logs): fix filename duplication, improve time calculation, and
  prevent recursive tracking


  - Fixed filename generation to exclude dev-log files and auto-generated files

  - Improved time calculation to use git history instead of filesystem timestamps

  - Added recursive tracking prevention for auto-generated commits

  - Enhanced both pre-commit and post-commit scripts with better filtering


  Fixes:

  1. No more duplicate filenames like ''2025-06-23-docs-2025-06-23-docs-refactor.yml''

  2. More accurate time tracking using git log --follow

  3. Prevents infinite loops when tracking dev-log changes

  4. Smarter file exclusion patterns for meaningful filenames'
