description: 'feat(workflow): implement comprehensive workflow automation and quality
  gates


  - Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with multi-version testing

  - Implement pre-push hook for code quality enforcement

  - Strengthen CLAUDE.md rules to prevent direct git commands

  - Create ADR-020 documenting workflow improvements

  - Fix all failing tests (Header navigation and API mocks)


  This ensures code quality through multiple automated checkpoints:

  1. Pre-commit: Tests, linting, type checking via Makefile

  2. Pre-push: Final safety check before pushing

  3. CI/CD: GitHub Actions for continuous integration

  4. AI Rules: Enforce proper workflow usage'
