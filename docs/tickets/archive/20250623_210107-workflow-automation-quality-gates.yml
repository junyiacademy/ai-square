  feature: 'feat(workflow): implement comprehensive workflow automation and quality
    gates


    - Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with multi-version testing

    - Implement pre-push hook for code quality enforcement

    - Strengthen CLAUDE.md rules to prevent direct git commands

    - Create ADR-020 documenting workflow improvements

    - Fix all failing tests (Header navigation and API mocks)


    This ensures code quality through multiple automated checkpoints:

    1. Pre-commit: Tests, linting, type checking via Makefile

    2. Pre-push: Final safety check before pushing

    3. CI/CD: GitHub Actions for continuous integration

    4. AI Rules: Enforce proper workflow usage'
