spec:
  feature: 'fix(dev-logs): fix filename duplication, improve time calculation, and
    prevent recursive tracking


    - Fixed filename generation to exclude dev-log files and auto-generated files

    - Improved time calculation to use git history instead of filesystem timestamps

    - Added recursive tracking prevention for auto-generated commits

    - Enhanced both pre-commit and post-commit scripts with better filtering


    Fixes:

    1. No more duplicate filenames like ''2025-06-23-docs-2025-06-23-docs-refactor.yml''

    2. More accurate time tracking using git log --follow

    3. Prevents infinite loops when tracking dev-log changes

    4. Smarter file exclusion patterns for meaningful filenames'
