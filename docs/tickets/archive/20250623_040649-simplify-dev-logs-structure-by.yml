spec:
  feature: 'refactor: simplify dev logs structure by removing subdirectory categorization


    - Flattened all dev logs to be directly under date folders

    - Moved 35 files from subdirectories (features/, bugfixes/, etc.) to date folder
    root

    - Updated ADR-017 to reflect new simplified structure

    - Updated handbook guides (development-logs-guide.md, commit-guide.md)

    - Updated dev-logs README.md to match new structure

    - Removed redundant subdirectory categorization since filenames already contain
    type info

    - Cleaned up temporary migration script


    The new structure is simpler and relies on clear filenames for categorization.'
