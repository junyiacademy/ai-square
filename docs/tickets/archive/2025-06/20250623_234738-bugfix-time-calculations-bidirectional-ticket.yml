spec:
  feature: 'fix(devlog): fix time calculations and implement bidirectional ticket
    linking


    - Fix dev log time calculation errors (was showing 0.7min instead of 10.6min)

    - Implement bidirectional linking between tickets and dev logs

    - Add automatic ticket creation if no active ticket exists

    - Convert ticket system from JSON to YAML with timestamps

    - Fix all existing dev log filenames to include timestamps

    - Update pre-commit and post-commit scripts for better time handling

    - Add ADR-027 documenting dev log standards enforcement


    Key fixes:

    - Pre-commit now properly calculates time from git history

    - Post-commit preserves pre-commit time calculations unless it has better data

    - Dev log filenames now include HH-MM-SS timestamps

    - Tickets and dev logs reference each other''s paths'
