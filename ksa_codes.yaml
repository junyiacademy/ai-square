# ----------  Knowledge (K) ----------
knowledge_codes:
  K1.1: "AI uses algorithms & statistics to detect patterns and generate outputs."
  K1.2: "Machine learning infers rules from data and adapts after deployment."
  K1.3: "Generative AI produces human-like outputs but lacks intent or true understanding."
  K1.4: "AI system types differ (create / predict / recommend / respond)."

  K2.1: "Humans design AI; choices & labor conditions shape outputs."
  K2.2: "Training data comes from public, user-generated, curated, sensor sources."
  K2.3: "AI gathers new interaction data that alters future outputs."
  K2.4: "Training selects, labels, and prioritizes data; AI finds patterns within."
  K2.5: "Bias exists in AI life-cycle; humans can perpetuate or mitigate it."
