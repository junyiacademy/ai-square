# CLAUDE.md - AI Square Project

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### Infrastructure First
- Use production-grade solutions from Day 1
- Never create temporary scripts or workarounds
- "There is nothing more permanent than a temporary solution"

### Development Workflow
```bash
make ai-new TYPE=feature TICKET=name   # Start new work
make ai-save                          # Save progress (track complexity)
make ai-done                          # Complete (test+commit+merge)
```

## ☁️ GCP Configuration

**Project**: `ai-square-463013` | **Account**: `youngtsai@junyiacademy.org` | **Region**: `asia-east1`

**CRITICAL**: Before any GCP operation, verify configuration:
```bash
gcloud config list  # Must show correct project/account/region
```

If incorrect, use `gcp-config-manager` agent to fix.

**Note**: Hook system automatically reminds you to verify GCP config when GCP keywords are detected.

## 🤖 MANDATORY: Use Agents Manager

**CRITICAL RULE**: For **ANY** task beyond simple questions, YOU MUST use `agents-manager`.

### When to Use agents-manager

**Use for** (basically everything):
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Deployments
- TypeScript errors
- Architecture changes
- Code reviews
- Quality checks
- Git operations
- Any task requiring validation

**DO NOT use for**:
- Simple questions ("What's in the PRD?")
- Reading documentation

### How to Use

```
Task(
    subagent_type="agents-manager",
    description="Brief task description",
    prompt="Detailed explanation of what needs to be done"
)
```

**The agents-manager will**:
- Analyze the task
- Determine which specialized agents to call
- Coordinate multiple agents if needed
- Ensure all quality standards are met

### agents-manager Coordinates

Infrastructure → infrastructure-first-agent
Testing → tdd-validator-agent
Architecture → unified-architecture-guardian
Security → security-audit-agent
Code Quality → code-quality-enforcer
TypeScript Errors → typescript-eslint-fixer
Deployment → deployment-pipeline-agent
GCP Config → gcp-config-manager
Documentation → documentation-sync-agent
Git Operations → git-commit-push
```

See `.claude/agents/agents-manager.md` for full decision tree.

## 📏 Code Quality Standards (Quick Reference)

### TypeScript Rules
1. **Zero `any` types** - Use `Record<string, unknown>` or specific types
2. **No `@ts-ignore`** - Fix root cause
3. **Next.js 15 routes** - Must `await` params:
   ```typescript
   export default async function Page(props: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
     const params = await props.params;
   }
   ```
4. **Multilingual fields** - `Record<string, string>`:
   ```typescript
   { title: { en: "Math", zh: "數學" } }
   ```

### Pre-Commit Requirements
```bash
make pre-commit-check  # Must pass: TypeScript, ESLint, Tests, Build
```

## 🎯 Context Management

**Use `/clear` frequently** (Anthropic research-backed best practice):
- Before new feature
- Before bug fixing
- When context > 50k tokens
- When switching focus
- Use `/context-check` command to monitor token usage

**Why**: Prevents context pollution, improves accuracy by ~15%, reduces token waste

## 🧠 Extended Thinking Mode

**When to Activate Extended Thinking**:
Extended Thinking is a deep analysis mode that should be triggered for complex problems requiring comprehensive reasoning.

**Trigger Phrases**:
- "think about this deeply"
- "analyze all options"
- "consider all edge cases"
- "what are all the implications"
- "explore different approaches"

**Use Cases**:
- Architecture decisions affecting multiple systems
- Complex debugging requiring root cause analysis
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Multi-step migration planning

**Example**:
```
User: "Think about how to refactor our authentication system to support SSO"

Claude: [Enters Extended Thinking mode]
- Analyzes current auth flow
- Evaluates SSO protocols (OAuth2, SAML, OIDC)
- Considers database schema changes
- Assesses security implications
- Plans migration strategy
- Identifies breaking changes
```

**When NOT to use**:
- Simple bug fixes
- Straightforward feature additions
- Code formatting changes
- Documentation updates

## 🚀 Claude Code 2025 Best Practices

### Plan Mode Strategy
**Automatically enter Plan Mode for**:
- New features affecting 3+ files
- Architecture refactoring
- Multi-step deployments
- Complex bug investigations

**In Plan Mode**: Read-only operations, create comprehensive plan, then exit before implementation.

**Pattern**:
```
1. Enter Plan Mode
2. Read relevant files
3. Create detailed plan
4. Exit Plan Mode
5. Implement step-by-step
```

### Subagent Strategy (Context Preservation)
**Use subagents to preserve main context**:
- Investigations that don't need immediate action
- Verification tasks separate from implementation
- Code review independent of coding
- Complex searches

**Pattern**: One Claude writes code, another reviews; one writes tests, another writes implementation.

**Example**:
```
Task(subagent_type="agents-manager", ...)  # Investigation
[Main Claude continues with implementation]
```

### Visual Iteration for UI Development
**Workflow**: Screenshot → Implement → Screenshot → Compare → Iterate

Use `/visual-test` command for:
1. Request design reference/screenshot
2. Build component
3. Take screenshot of implementation
4. Adjust until pixel-perfect
5. Add Playwright visual regression test

**Impact**: Reduces design iteration cycles from 5+ to 2-3

### Anti-Patterns to Eliminate
**Remove from outputs** (improves accuracy by 5%+ per Anthropic SWE-Bench):

1. Hedging language: "might", "could potentially", "perhaps"
2. Excessive explanation of obvious concepts
3. Agreement phrases: "I understand", "Sure", "Of course"
4. Emotional acknowledgments without technical value

**Be direct and technical**:
- ✅ "I'll implement the auth endpoint using Repository Pattern"
- ❌ "Sure! I'd be happy to help you implement the auth endpoint. Of course, I'll use the Repository Pattern as that might be the best approach here."

### Headless Mode for Scale
**Use `claude -p` for**:
- Large-scale migrations
- Bulk file processing
- Automated test generation
- Fan-out pattern: Generate task list, loop through with programmatic calls

### Prompt Optimization Principles
**Be extremely specific**:
- ✅ "Next.js 15.1.0 with App Router, TypeScript 5.3.3, Tailwind 3.4"
- ❌ "Next.js with TypeScript"

**Use emphasis for critical rules**:
- "IMPORTANT:", "YOU MUST", "CRITICAL:" for non-negotiable requirements
- Improves instruction-following by ~15%

**Constant refinement**:
- Treat CLAUDE.md as living document
- Update based on results
- Remove what doesn't help
- Add specific examples

### Commands Available
- `/context-check` - Monitor token usage and context health
- `/visual-test` - Screenshot-based UI iteration workflow
- `/clear` - Reset context to prevent pollution

## 🗄️ Database Management Strategy

**CRITICAL**: Production uses unified Prisma-based schema (migrated 2025-08-19)

### Schema Management: Prisma Only
```bash
# Create new migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name description

# Apply to production
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate
```

**Official Migrations**: `prisma/migrations/` (tracked in git)
**Deleted Obsolete**: `src/db/migrations/`, `src/lib/db/migrations/`, `schema-v4.sql`

### Data Access: Repository Pattern with Raw SQL
- **65+ API routes** use Repositories (`src/lib/repositories/`)
- **Query execution**: Raw SQL via `pool.query()` (NOT Prisma Client)
- **Complex queries**: Raw SQL for performance (e.g., weekly report)
- **Why raw SQL**: Performance, flexibility for complex joins/aggregations

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. **ENUMs → TEXT**: All PostgreSQL ENUMs converted to TEXT for flexibility
2. **Prisma for schema**: Migrations and schema definition
3. **Raw SQL for queries**: Performance and Repository Pattern compatibility
4. **Mode-based analytics**: Tracks assessment/pbl/discovery separately

### Migration Workflow Going Forward
```bash
1. Design schema change in prisma/schema.prisma
2. Run: npx prisma migrate dev --name add_feature_x
3. Test in development
4. Deploy to staging: npx prisma migrate deploy
5. Verify production: Check migration status
6. Never modify old migrations (immutable)
```

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- `scripts/init-cloud-sql.sh` references deleted `schema-v4.sql` (needs update or removal)
- Keep both Prisma AND Repository Pattern (don't consolidate to Prisma Client)

## 🔒 Git Workflow Rules

**CRITICAL USER RULE**: Only user can command commit and push!

**Agent Behavior**:
- ✅ Prepare changes and stage files
- ✅ Present summary for review
- ✅ Ask user for explicit confirmation
- ❌ **NEVER** auto-commit without user command
- ❌ **NEVER** auto-push without user command

**User must explicitly say**: "commit", "push", "提交", "推送"

**Pattern**:
```
Agent: "Changes ready. Files staged:
- file1.ts
- file2.ts

To commit: say 'commit' or '提交'
To push: say 'push' or '推送'"
```
