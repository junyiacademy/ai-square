# Migration to Pure Infrastructure as Code

## Overview
This migration removes all shell script dependencies from the Terraform configuration to follow pure Infrastructure as Code principles.

## Changes Made

### 1. Shell Scripts Removed
- ❌ `deploy-complete.sh` - Complex deployment orchestration script
- ❌ `security-check.sh` - Security validation script  
- ❌ `test-deployment-pipeline.sh` - End-to-end testing script

### 2. Makefile Enhanced
- ✅ Security checks integrated into Make targets
- ✅ Deployment pipeline implemented with native Make commands
- ✅ Health checks and monitoring built into targets
- ✅ All functionality preserved without shell dependencies

### 3. New Make Targets Added
```bash
wait-for-health      # Wait for service to be healthy
deployment-summary   # Generate deployment summary  
security-check       # Run security audit using native commands
```

### 4. Pure Terraform Approach
- All post-deployment tasks handled by Terraform provisioners in `post-deploy.tf`
- Security validation uses native Terraform/Make commands
- No external script dependencies for deployment

## Benefits

### Infrastructure as Code Compliance
- ✅ Single source of truth in `.tf` files
- ✅ Declarative infrastructure definition
- ✅ Version-controlled infrastructure state
- ✅ Reproducible deployments

### Maintenance Benefits
- ✅ Reduced complexity - no shell script debugging
- ✅ Better error handling with Terraform providers
- ✅ Cleaner Git history without shell script changes
- ✅ Standard Terraform tooling and workflows

### Security Benefits  
- ✅ No executable scripts in repository
- ✅ Built-in validation with Make commands
- ✅ Consistent security checking across environments

## Usage

### Before (Shell Scripts)
```bash
./deploy-complete.sh staging
./security-check.sh
```

### After (Pure Terraform)
```bash
make deploy-staging
make security-check
```

## Migration Notes

- All deployment functionality preserved
- E2E tests still run via Make targets
- Security validation maintained with native commands
- Post-deployment tasks handled by Terraform provisioners
- Legacy import scripts kept in `scripts/` for migration purposes only

## Validation

Run these commands to verify the migration:
```bash
make help                    # Show all available commands
make security-check          # Verify security validation works
make plan ENV=staging        # Test Terraform planning
make status ENV=staging      # Test health checking
```
